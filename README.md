The following repo consists of my solutions to the course projects for the Deep learning courses offered by deeplearning.ai specialization on Coursera.


Key projects:

Residual Networks Architecture Implementation in Keras

•	Built a very deep CNN model using Residual Network (ResNets) architecture with 50 Layers in Keras and used the model to classify images on SIGN dataset.

Art Generation with Neural Style Transfer

•	Used transfer learning from VGG19 convnet model to generate an image of Louvre museum in Paris (Content Image) mixed with an impressionist style painting by Claude Monet (Style Image) in Tensorflow. 

Face Recognition Model

•	Using Tensorflow and Keras, implemented Triple Loss Function between Anchor image, Positive image and Negative image.

Emojifier

•	Used word vector representations to build an Emojifier (model to predict the emoji based on the input sentence).
•	Implemented a LSTM model in Keras with pretrained word embeddings on Glove model as input.

Improvise a Jazz Solo with an LSTM network

•	Implemented a model in Keras that uses an LSTM to learn the pattern of Jazz soloist and then generated the sequences of Jazz music using a second model. 

Neural Machine Translation with Attention

•	Implemented a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) with Attention model to translate human readable dates into machine readable dates in Keras.
